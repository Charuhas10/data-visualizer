# Data Visualizer

##

This is a web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack along with Python Flask API. The application allows users to ingest data via a form or an Excel sheet, store the data in a database, perform analytics using a Python script, store the script output in the database, and visualize both the data and the script output in the frontend.
